# Survival Analysis
The user base at Reposo is made up of roughly 5% of users that are creators who thrive (tier 1), 25% of users that create content but have a high churn rate and have limited success (tier 2), and the remaining 70% of the user base are pure consumers. The “free-riding” problem is common in social media platforms, and while it may seem disconcerting this large base of ready consumers is one of the reasons that creators succeed. The focus of this project is to improve the success of the tier 2 creators. The key challenge is to understand differences in usage of the platform in improving the success of tier 2 creators.
